            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>INprimis,</hi> You must take all at once, that is one sealed Paper, in the pap of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted Apple, as big as an Hasel nut, before you rise in a morning fasting, and within one hour after, drink some Posset-drink, or some broth made of fresh meat, or with fresh Butter, using the said broth or Posset-drink 3 or 4 times in one hour, keeping your bed until noon that day, or warm in your chamber, at least 3 hours.</p>

            <p n="3">3 Half of it will be enough for children betwixt 7 and 14 years of age, and a quarter for those that are between four and seven.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Note, that if the broth which is taken one hour after the remedy, not salted at all, then you shall vomit three or four times; contrariwise, if you take your broth well salted, you shall vomit little or none at all, for it will work all down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p n="5">5 For all kind of Tertian Agues, or other intermittent Feavers, it is an excellent Remedy, being taken at the least 3 hours, or rather more, before the fits come, and your broth being not salt, causeth vomiting, being very good for it, especally for Quartane Agues or Feavers, and alwayes in the morning fasting.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Likewise for the Falling sickness and the Dropsy, using it once in a week for nine weeks space.</p>

            <p n="9">9 It is most good, chiefly for preventing of Diseases, using it in the Spring time, but you may use it at all times, observing the Rules of the second and third Articles abovesaid.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Those that have Itches, Scabs, Morphews, must use it often, and those that have had any carnal dealing with an unclean woman, must certainly use it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be twenty year ago; and so for women with unclean men.</p>
            <p n="11">11 All the operation of it is done in 3 hours; the which being ended, you may rise from your bed, and go about your business; and those that use only the steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or infusion of it, they may keep the powder that remains in the bottom, for any other time, taking powder and all the second time, without any more steeping.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This Remedy will keep good during the whole life of man, and generally it is good for far and corpulent folks, to use it with salt broths after the receit, which causeth the operation downwards, contrary to lean folks: it causeth gentle and easie vomits, their both being not salted.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Note, that for a third daies Agues, you must have three of them to take, not every third day following, but every third one, in the day of the fit, but not in the fit, and in the morning ever before the fit.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Women with child must forbear the use of this Remedy, and Children that are two years of age, and those that have had any bloody fluxes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
